### EMPLOYMENT HISTORY

SQL Developer, MAPSOFT\
Minsk, Belarus\
Dec 2022 - Present

Starting my career in the company as a Junior SQL Developer, I
completely mastered all the necessary skills from scratch.

In our work, we use a comprehensive database containing numerous
tables with complex relationships. This structure supports various
accounting systems, such as financial and medical.

My work involves developing and optimizing a database for one of the
country's leading universities. The project aims to improve performance
and data protection, as well as create a user-friendly and intuitive
interface for end-users. We have successfully implemented solutions
that have signifcantly accelerated the development process, increased
the volume of work performed, and improved the quality of the
software.

Due to a shortage of staff, I had to learn all aspects of the work on
my own without guidance from a mentor. By gradually studying and
correcting mistakes, I gained deep knowledge and valuable experience.
